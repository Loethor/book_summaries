# Book Summaries Repository

Welcome to my book summaries repository! This is where I store summaries of the books I read. Each book has its own folder, and each folder contains a README file that provides a summary of the book's contents.

## Books

Here's a list of the books I've summarized so far:

- [Book Title 1](./book-1/README.md)
- [Book Title 2](./book-2/README.md)
- [Book Title 3](./book-3/README.md)

## How to Use This Repository

To access a summary for a particular book, simply click on the link to the book's folder above. This will take you to the README file for that book, which contains a summary of its contents.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository by adding your own book summaries, please feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes. I'd love to see what books you've been reading and what insights you've gained from them!

Thank you for visiting my book summaries repository. Happy reading!
