# Book Summaries Repository

Welcome to my book summaries repository! This is where I store summaries of the books I read. Each book has its own folder, and each folder contains a README file that provides a summary of the book's contents.

## Books

Here's a list of the books I've summarized so far:

- [*Deep Work: Rules For Focused Success In A Distracted World*](./deep-work/readme.md)
- [*Ultralearning: Accelerate Your Career, Master Hard Skills and Outsmart the Competition*](./ultralearning/readme.md)
- [*The 7 Habits Of Highly Effective People*](./seven-habits/readme.md)
- [*Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones*](./atomic-habits/readme.md)

## How to Use This Repository

To access a summary for a particular book, simply click on the link to the book's folder above. This will take you to the README file for that book, which contains a summary of its contents.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this repository by adding your own book summaries, please feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes. I'd love to see what books you've been reading and what insights you've gained from them!
