### Foreword by James Clear ([*Atomic Habits*](../atomic-habits/readme.md))

In the foreword, James Clear discusses how Scott H. Young inspired and influenced him to become a successful writer. James Clear encourages the reader about the benefits of *ultralearning*.

## Chapter 1: Can You Get an MIT Education Without Going to MIT?

Scott presents multiple cases (including his own life experience) of people challenging (and succeding) themselves into learning and hard skill in a limited amount of time.

Scott, for example, takes the full four years of MIT Computer Science in a single year of self-study. He explain how this self-challenge was created, what were the conditions and how he started to developt some of the techniques later described in this book.

Another of the stories belongs to Benny Lewis, a hyperpolyglot that challenges himself into becoming fluent on specific languages in three months. Benny offers some advices such as having a challenge, start speaking the first day, don't be afraid to talk to strangers.

The next story is about how Roger Craig defeated [*Jeopardy*!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!), the american contest. How do you study to answer questions about literally anything? He explains the methodology he used to understand his strong and weak points, and how he used this as an advantage to win five games in a row, achieving the highest single-day winnings at a time.

The last example, my favorite, talks about Eric Barone also known as [ConcernedApe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Barone_(developer)). Eric single handedly developed the game [*Stardew Valley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley), a game about owning a farm. The task of developing a videogame includes learning skills such as  writing, music, or visual arts. In the period of 5 years he created a game of highly-awarded fame, selling more than 30 millions of copies.

Scott continues the chapter by explaining how his MIT challenge became famous in the internet. Multiple people contacted him to offer him career opportunities. After his MIT challenge was finished, he decided to travel during a year with a friend. Expending three months in each of four countries (Spain, Brazil, China, and South Korea) the pair of friends challenge themselves to not to speak English during this trip. They both learned each countries' languages to a conversational level. Scott also shares how he applied this techniques to improve his drawing skills.

The chapter conclues with an extended community of *ultralearners*, each of them with their own learning experiences and similitudes.
