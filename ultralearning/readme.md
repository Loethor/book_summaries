## Chapter 1: Can You Get an MIT Education Without Going to MIT?

The author presents multiple cases (including his own life experience) of people challenging (and succeding) themselves into learning and hard skill in a limited amount of time.

### The MIT Challenge

The author, for example, takes the full four years of [MIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology) Computer Science in a single year of self-study. He explain how this self-challenge was created, what were the conditions and how he started to developt some of the techniques later described in this book.

### Fluent in three months?

Another of the stories belongs to [Benny Lewis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Lewis), a hyperpolyglot that challenges himself into becoming fluent on specific languages in three months. Benny offers some advices such as having a challenge, start speaking the first day, don't be afraid to talk to strangers.

### How Roger Craig gamed *Jeopardy*!

The next story is about how [Roger Craig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Craig_(Jeopardy!_contestant)) defeated [*Jeopardy*!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeopardy!), the american contest. How do you study to answer questions about literally anything? He explains the methodology he used to understand his strong and weak points, and how he used this as an advantage to win five games in a row, achieving the highest single-day winnings at a time.

### From minimum wage to millionary

The last example, my favorite, talks about Eric Barone also known as [ConcernedApe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Barone_(developer)). Eric single handedly developed the game [*Stardew Valley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley), a game about owning a farm. The task of developing a videogame includes learning skills such as  writing, music, or visual arts. In the period of 5 years he created a game of highly-awarded fame, selling more than 30 millions of copies.

### The MIT challenge and beyond

Scott continues the chapter by explaining how his MIT challenge became famous in the internet. Multiple people contacted him to offer him career opportunities. After his MIT challenge was finished, he decided to travel during a year with a friend. Expending three months in each of four countries (Spain, Brazil, China, and South Korea) the pair of friends challenge themselves to not to speak English during this trip. They both learned each countries' languages to a conversational level. Scott also shares how he applied this techniques to improve his drawing skills.

### Uncovering the ultraleaners

The chapter conclues with an extended community of *ultralearners*, each of them with their own learning experiences and similitudes.

## Chapter 2: Why *Ultralearning* Matters

The author starts the chapter by providing a rough definition of ultralearning:

*"A strategy for adquiring skills and knowledge that is both self-directed and intense."*

*Ultralearning* is a:
 - **Strategy:** It is not only a solution to a problem, but a good one too.
 - **Self-directed:** It is about you make the decisions about what to learn and why.
 - **Intense:** Taking unsual steps to maximize effectiveness in learning.

 *Ultralearning* is shown as the opposite of learning optimized for fun and convience (e.g., langueage learning apps). 

### Ultralearning is hard

Ultralearning is challenging and hard. It requires active effort, pushing yourself to do something that will strain you mentally, emotionally and even physically. The author proposes to reasons to consider:
 - Your **work**: Learning hard skills can have a greater impact than years of mediocre striving on the job.
 - Your **personal** life: Your deepest moments of happiness don't come from doing easy things; they come from realizing your potential and overcoming your own limiting beliefs about yourself.

### Average is over

 [Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen) proposes on his book [*Average is Over*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average_Is_Over) that due computerization, automation, outsorcing, and regionalization we are increasingly living in a world where top performers do a lot better than the rest.

 The author explains (based in multiple studies) about "skill polarization".The medium-skill jobs are dissapearing while the high-skilled and low-skilled jobs remain. With the disappearance of medium-skill jobs, it is not enough to get a basic education and work hard everyday to succeed. You need, with effort, to move into the higher-skilled category, where learning is constant, or you will be pushed ino the lower-skilled category.

### Education: Tuiton is too high

 The author also explain how the tuiton is too high. University not only has become more and more expensive, it also doesn't prepare you for the next steps in life.

### Technology: New frontiers in learning

 Technology is also in the highest of the human civilization. An amount of information vaster than was held by the Library of Alexandria is freely accesible to anyone with a device and internet connection. The space of learning possibilities is inmense, just waiting for ambitius autodidacts to come up with new ways to exploit it.
 Although *ultralearning* doesn't require any technology it offers and incredible opportunity for innocation.

 ### Accelerate, transition, and rescue your career with *ultralearning*

 There are three main cases that this strategy can apply:
  - Accelerating your career: By choosing a valuable skill and focusing on quickly developing profieciency, you can accelerate your normal career progression.
  - Trainsitioning to a new career: Adquiring missing skills can help you switch fields and get a job in the field that you want.
  - Cultivating a hidden advante in competitive world: Adding new skill to your arsenal can make you indispensable.
